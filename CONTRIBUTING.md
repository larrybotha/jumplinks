Thanks for your interest in contributing the Jumplinks for ProcessWire project.

As an open-source project, contributions are always welcome. Feel free to submit ideas and concerns over at the [official support thread](https://processwire.com/talk/topic/8697-jumplinks/). Note that support requests should also go there, and not in the repo issue tracker, which is **only** for reporting possible bugs and oversights, etc. Roadmaps are also posted in the issue tracker, but this may only be done by the project author (or team member, if applicable) for the purposes of tracking milestone progress.

When submitting possible-bug reports to the issue tracker, please be sure to include as much information as possible. At the very least, be sure to post:

1. Your ProcessWire version
2. Your Jumplinks version
3. Steps to reproduce the issue you're encountering
4. If the issue is UI/UX-related, please upload a screenshot

Optionally, feel free to mention ny suggestions you may have to fix the issue.
